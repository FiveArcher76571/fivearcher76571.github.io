Please take a look! About Me My name is Saicharan Vemuri. I am 18 years old and attend the University of Michigan College of Engineering. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and a Minor in Japanese Language. My interests and hobbies include programming, music, and video games. I try to pursue all of these through my education and activities. In this website, you'll find things I've worked on, and it'll be slowly growing as the years progress (at least I hope it will). Languages In an effort to not only cater to many people, but also to practice my own skills, this website can be seen in three languages: English, Japanese, and Telugu. While English and Telugu are my native tongues, I am still trying to improve my Japanese and Telugu skills, so please excuse any mistakes that I may make, and I will do my best to fix them. The Telugu and Japanese versions are not currently ready, but you will be able to see them when they are!","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome","text":"You've reached my portfolio!
