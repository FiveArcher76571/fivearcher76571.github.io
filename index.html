  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <p>You've reached my portfolio! Please take a look!</p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>My name is Saicharan Vemuri. I am 18 years old and attend the University of Michigan College of Engineering. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and a Minor in Japanese Language.</p>
  <p>My interests and hobbies include programming, music, and video games. I try to pursue all of these through my education and activities.</p>
  <p>In this website, you'll find things I've worked on, and it'll be slowly growing as the years progress (at least I hope it will).</p>
  <p style="font-size: 40%;"><br></p>
  <h2>Languages</h2>
  <p>In an effort to not only cater to many people, but also to practice my own skills, this website can be seen in three languages: English, Japanese, and Telugu. While English and Telugu are my native tongues, I am still trying to improve my Japanese and Telugu skills, so please excuse any mistakes that I may make, and I will do my best to fix them. The Telugu and Japanese versions are not currently ready, but you will be able to see them when they are!</p>
